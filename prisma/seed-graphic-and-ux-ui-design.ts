        description: `I developed high-impact visual campaigns for major brands across diverse outdoor media formats. 
          Working with leading companies like Pubext 2000, I created compelling billboard designs, transit advertising, street furniture graphics, and large-format displays that captured consumer attention in high-traffic urban environments. 
          My role involved translating brand messaging into visually striking designs optimized for outdoor viewing conditions, considering factors like viewing distance, lighting conditions, and brief exposure times. 
          I collaborated closely with clients to ensure brand consistency across multi-format campaigns while adapting designs for various outdoor advertising placements including highways, bus stops, metro stations, and commercial districts. This experience honed my skills in large-scale design thinking, brand adaptation, and creating memorable visual impact within the constraints of outdoor advertising regulations and production requirements.
