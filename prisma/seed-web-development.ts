          This portfolio is developed using cutting-edge technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Prisma ORM — providing a fast, modern, and fully responsive experience across devices. 
          The site is more than just a static portfolio — it includes a fully featured admin interface, designed like a lightweight CMS. Through this dashboard, I can easily manage and update the content of the site, including projects, skills, and blog posts, without touching the codebase. It’s a custom solution that reflects my approach to building scalable, maintainable applications. 
          If you're curious to see how the admin panel works, you can request access to a sample account. Just head over to the Contact section and drop me a message — I’ll be happy to share the credentials so you can explore the admin experience yourself. Whether you're here to check out my work, connect with me professionally, or test the tech behind the scenes, thanks for visiting!

          "The Jokes API is a web app offering a selection of random jokes, allowing users to rate, filter by category, and even submit their own jokes for endless entertainment.",
        description: `This is a modern full-stack web application designed to help pet owners, veterinarians, and caretakers efficiently manage the animals under their care. 
          With a clean, user-friendly interface, PetSoft allows users to keep track of medical records, visits, vaccinations, treatments, and more — all in one centralized and accessible place.
          From a technical perspective, PetSoft is built using Next.js and TypeScript for a robust and scalable frontend architecture. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and maintainable UI. The backend is powered by Prisma ORM, interfacing with a relational database to ensure secure and performant data handling.
          A key feature of the app is its admin dashboard, which works as a custom CMS. Through this panel, administrators can manage pets, users, veterinarians, and view complete medical histories. Visitors can also request access to a sample account to explore the administrator panel and test its capabilities — just reach out via the contact section on the site.
          Please note: PetSoft is a demo and training project created following the Professional React & Next.js course by ByteGrad, not a real commercial product.
