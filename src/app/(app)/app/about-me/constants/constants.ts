  "paragraph1": "My name is Franco Gabriel Amoroso, and my journey with technology began in my childhood in Argentina. This passion has been a constant in my life, sparked by growing up around my father's computer store in the 90s, a place filled with vintage computers that marked the dawn of the modern computer science. In 2018, I moved to Australia, spending three formative years immersed in a new culture and expanding my perspectives. Since 2020, I've made my home in the south of Spain.",
